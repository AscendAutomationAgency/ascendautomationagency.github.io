## CRM Platform Deep Dive

### Dedicated CRM Systems

| CRM | May | January | Change | Market Assessment |
|-----|-----|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **GoHighLevel** | 561 | 645 | +15.0% | **Breakout performer, strongest growth of any major app** |
| **HubSpot** | 334 | 350 | +4.8% | **Steady recovery, enterprise demand stable** |
| **Salesforce** | 87 | 88 | +1.1% | Volatile but net positive over 9 months |
| **Zoho** | 103 | 82 | -20.4% | Sharp January pullback reverses prior gains |

**Key Insight:** The CRM landscape split in January. GoHighLevel (+14.8% MoM) and HubSpot (+5.1% MoM) surged on Q1 budget resets, while Zoho collapsed -32.8% and Salesforce pulled back -8.3%. GoHighLevel is now the clear CRM winner with +15.0% total growth—the strongest total growth of any major application in the entire dataset.

### Generic "CRM" Mentions

| Month | Mentions | Change |
|-------|----------|--------|
| May | 1,202 | Baseline |
| December | 1,258 | +14.1% MoM |
| January | 1,239 | -1.5% MoM |

Generic CRM mentions essentially flat (-1.5%), suggesting steady demand for CRM-related automation work heading into Q1.

### Alternative CRM Solutions

| Application | May | January | Change | Assessment |
|-------------|-----|---------|--------|------------|
| **Airtable** | 666 | 467 | -29.9% | Database/workflow declining significantly |
| **Notion** | 433 | 273 | -36.9% | Sharpest total decline of alternatives |
| **ClickUp** | 195 | 146 | -25.1% | December rebound didn't hold |
| **Monday.com** | 108 | 102 | -5.6% | Most stable alternative |

**Combined Alternative CRMs:** 886 jobs (January) vs 1,294 jobs (May) = -31.5%

**Insight:** Alternative CRM tools continue declining faster than dedicated platforms. The market clearly prefers purpose-built CRM solutions, especially GoHighLevel for agencies and HubSpot for enterprise.

- January: 3,945 jobs (+0.2% MoM, -28.6% from peak)
- **First non-negative month since July**

**Assessment:** January's +0.2% confirms the market floor. Combined with December's moderate -6.3% (vs November's -16.5% crash), the market has stabilized around 3,950 monthly jobs.

### Rate Surge

| Month | Avg Rate | High-Paying Count ($75+) | Trend |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|-------|
| May | $39.10/hr | 153 | Baseline |
| July | $39.61/hr | 214 | Peak volume |
| December | $37.58/hr | 144 | Trough |
| January | $40.20/hr | 165 | **All-time high** |

**Analysis:** January's +7.0% rate surge is the largest single-month increase since tracking began. The $40.20/hr average surpasses July's $39.61 peak despite 29% fewer jobs. High-paying jobs jumped +14.6% to 165. Q1 budget resets are clearly driving premium engagements.

### Platform Leadership

| Make.com | 751 (19.1%) | 725 (18.4%) | -0.7 pts |

**Zapier's two-month growth streak** (+5.5%, +0.8%) vs n8n's accelerating decline (-3.8%, -7.7%) opens a significant gap. Zapier now leads n8n by 232 jobs and 5.9 share points—the widest gap since November.
