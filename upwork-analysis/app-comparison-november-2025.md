## Executive Summary

November 2025 marks a significant market contraction with total jobs dropping -16.5% to 4,203—the sharpest monthly decline of the year and the lowest volume since data collection began. All major platforms experienced double-digit declines: Zapier -22.0%, Make.com -21.0%, n8n -14.6%. However, average hourly rates recovered slightly to $38.79/hr (up from October's $38.17), suggesting quality over quantity dynamics.

## November Market Dynamics

### Significant Market Contraction

**Volume Trends:**
- July Peak: 5,522 jobs
- October: 5,031 jobs (-8.9% from peak)
- November: 4,203 jobs (-16.5% MoM, -23.9% from peak)
- **Largest single-month decline in tracking period**

**Assessment:** November represents either seasonal contraction, market maturation acceleration, or both. The depth of decline suggests structural shift rather than temporary fluctuation.

### Platform Leadership Change

**Historic Shift: n8n Overtakes Zapier**

| Platform | October | November | Share Change |
|----------|---------|----------|--------------|
| n8n | 2,024 (40.2%) | 1,729 (41.1%) | +0.9 pts |
| Zapier | 2,132 (42.4%) | 1,662 (39.5%) | -2.9 pts |
| Make.com | 1,027 (20.4%) | 811 (19.3%) | -1.1 pts |

**First time n8n leads market share.** Technical platform now dominates as commodity work contracts.

### Rate Recovery Signal

| Month | Avg Rate | High-Paying Count ($75+) | Trend |
|-------|----------|--------------------------|-------|
| May | $39.10/hr | 153 | Baseline |
| July | $39.61/hr | 214 | Peak |
| October | $38.17/hr | 179 | Compression |
| November | $38.79/hr | 139 | **Recovery** |

**Analysis:** While volume collapsed -16.5%, rates recovered +1.6% to $38.79/hr. High-paying jobs declined proportionally (-22.3%), tracking overall market. This suggests commodity work contracting faster than premium work.

### Winners in Downturn

- Monday.com: +4.1% (101 jobs)

**Most Resilient (Single-digit decline):**
- Zoho: -9.2% (128 jobs)
- GoHighLevel: -12.1% (579 jobs)
- Trello: -12.7% (48 jobs)

**Interpretation:** Clients consolidating around proven, essential tools. New and experimental automation work being cut first.
